In this project, I'm trying to copy the google main search page as well as a spoofed version of the results page.

In this first version (the homepage), I've demonstrated that I know how to do the following:
- structure pages with nested divs with appropriate ids
- style said divs using #selectors in CSS
- make use of various CSS features including flexbox and :hover selectors
- make a navbar and a footer
- make use of google fonts in a project
- include a form and include styling for specific types of inputs
- make use of CSS background image and opacity to recreate the google apps icon

Other notes:
- the form doesn't do anything
- all links are dead
- couldn't quickly figure out how to include the search or microphone icons in the search bar. probably could do so with more googling, but seemed outside the scope of this particular project
